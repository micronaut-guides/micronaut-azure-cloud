To see the log of your application running on Azure, you have to first enable storage of your app logging, and then perform a tail for live streaming.

To enable logging storage, use the following Azure CLI command. Check your `pom.xml` for the generated `<resourceGroup>` and the `<appName>`

`az webapp log config --name [appName] -g [resourceGroup] --web-server-logging filesystem`

Once this is done, you can then tail the log live from the cloud:

`az webapp log tail --name [appName] -g [resourceGroup]`

If you don't see any log, try changing the level of the project's Logback configuration in `logback.xml` to a higher value such as `debug`, then run the Maven deployment command again:

`mvn package azure-webapp:deploy`

And then run the tail command above once again.
