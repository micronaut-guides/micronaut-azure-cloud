After you've finished this guide, you can clean up the resources you created on
Azure so you won't take the risk of being billed because of them in the future. The following
sections describe how to delete or turn off these resources.

Delete the resource group and all of its resources created along this guide with the following command:

`az group delete -g [resourceGroup]`
